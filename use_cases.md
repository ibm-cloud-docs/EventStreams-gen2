The use cases for Kafka break down into three broad catagories: Stream processing, data pipelines, and event streaming. Some real-life examples of Kafka include streaming real-time rail data to provide passengers with up-to-the-minute information about their journeys, providing seamless streaming experience to users watching movies online, or fraud detection.
