## What does Beta mean for you?
{: #gen2-beta-meaning}

- Evaluation only: Beta instances are for testing and feedback, not for production use.
- {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} SLA does not apply.
- Visibility and access: Beta will start as closed (invite-only) in stages 1 and 2, and become public in stage 3.
- Billing: Beta services are not billable.
- Feature gaps: {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} Beta plans will not include key features, including Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) and context-based restrictions.
- Lifecycle: Beta instances will be removed at the end of the program, and {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} can remove instances at any point if too many instances are provisioned by a single user.

For more information, see [IBM Cloud Lifecycle phases](/docs/service-framework?topic=service-framework-lifecycle).
